    "abstract": "While teaching high school, I became fascinated with the ideas around Orthogonal Latin Squares, and a program written in 1963 for a 'UNIVAC 2106 Military Computer' that found them for order 10, proving a ~250 year old conjecture by Euler wrong. I found the paper, and rewrote it in Ruby. Lets play."

    "abstract": "The hardest part of learning to draw is figuring out that you have to draw what you actually see, not what you think you see. Draw a \"face\" and you end up with an emoji; draw shadows and shapes instead and you end up with a portrait. This talk takes that lesson and applies it to... well, everything."

    "abstract": "Fake news is not a tech problem, it's a human problem. To build the tools necessary to combat fake news, technologists must think differently. We must understand the psychology behind fake news to arrive at a solution that is human-centric and attainable."

Well, you can control it via TCP, and—using Ruby—we're gonna launch, orbit, and crash our brave Kerbins. You might even learn a thing or two about orbital mechanics and control theory along the way."

Listen to a former-orchestral-clarinetist-turned-developer talk about parallelisms between music performance and programming - such as complexity, imposter syndrome, and true concentration - with live performances throughout!"
